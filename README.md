# MultiVAC Design
Notes on the design draft

We are fortunate to have a strong community growing with us.
We used to interact with fans by roadshows in various places, and everyone liked our small designs very much. Unfortunately, physical delivery is currently inconvenient, and the impact of the COVID-19 has made it impossible for us to communicate face-to-face. Therefore, we decided to publish the design drawings so that more friends who like them can DIY.

To be honest, the emoji pack is very welcome. Although there are not many in number, the postures are different, which also represents the different moods we have had along the way. Next, we are about to move to the most important milestone, and we will establish more cooperation, hoping to live up to the trust.

Let there be light!
